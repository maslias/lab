One player must try to stay alive for 30 seconds, while the other players are piranhas. The 'piranhas' have one chance to steal the ball when they enter the paint. If they cannot get it within one strike, they must exit to a different side that they did not attack from. Once they get two feet outside the paint, they can enter again. Players get a point each time they achieve a successful bite (aka steal)!

One player begins in front of the defense, dribbling in any location. The offensive player attempts to 'fake out' the defender by getting them to move before they actually go. Every time the defender moves before the offense has actually started (moving both feet - note they are allowed to lift their free foot), the offense gets a bonus point. This leads to all sorts of deceptive behaviours and hesis emerging. This is a really fun activity that you can also play off the catch vs off the dribble (which leads to different types of jab step emerging without being taught explicitly).
